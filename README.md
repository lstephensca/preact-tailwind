# Preact + Tailwind + Vite

This is a small starter project for working with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). I have used ".keep" files to keep the empty folders in the repository, but feel free to delete them if you don't need them.

## Core Stack

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) as the JavaScript framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and building
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type safety
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management

## Optional Stack

- [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) for accessible UI components
- [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) for SVG icons

- [Tailwind Forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) for styling form elements
- [Tailwind Typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) for styling typography

## Getting started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone
cd preact-tailwind-vite
pnpm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash

```

## Building for production

To build the app for production, run:

The built files will be in the `dist` folder.
